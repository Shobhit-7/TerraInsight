# Environmental Monitoring Platform Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Design System (Material Design + Data Visualization)
**Justification**: This is a utility-focused, information-dense platform requiring data visualization excellence, scientific credibility, and dashboard functionality. Material Design provides the foundation with custom data visualization components.

## Core Design Elements

### A. Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Deep Blue: 210 100% 25% (trust, environmental focus)
- Light Blue: 210 60% 85% (data backgrounds, calm)

**Dark Mode:**
- Background: 210 25% 8%
- Surface: 210 20% 12%
- Text Primary: 210 10% 95%

**Data Visualization:**
- Air Quality: 350 70% 45% (warning red) to 120 60% 40% (healthy green)
- Water Security: 200 80% 50% (blue spectrum)
- Green Space: 110 50% 35% (forest green) to 80 60% 70% (light green)

### B. Typography
- **Primary**: Inter (clean, data-friendly)
- **Headings**: 24px/32px/18px (bold weights)
- **Body**: 14px/16px (regular/medium)
- **Data Labels**: 12px (medium, high contrast)

### C. Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Tailwind 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 units
- Dense data grids: p-2, gap-2
- Card spacing: p-4, m-4
- Section separation: py-8, my-6

### D. Component Library

**Dashboard Layout:**
- Split-screen: Map (70%) + Data panels (30%)
- Collapsible sidebar for dataset controls
- Top navigation with alert indicators

**Data Visualization:**
- Interactive choropleth maps with zoom controls
- Time-series charts with brush selection
- Gauge components for livability scores (0-100)
- Heat map overlays for risk zones

**Cards & Panels:**
- Metric cards with trend indicators
- Alert notification cards (color-coded by severity)
- Data source panels with refresh status
- Recommendation cards with action buttons

**Controls:**
- Multi-select dropdowns for datasets
- Date range pickers for temporal analysis
- Layer toggle switches for map overlays
- Filter panels with search capabilities

### E. Key Interface Sections

1. **Main Dashboard**: Split map/data view with real-time updates
2. **Dataset Management**: NASA/local data source configuration
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: ML model outputs and predictions
4. **Alert Center**: Risk notifications and recommendations
5. **Reports**: Exportable insights and trends

### F. Scientific Credibility Features
- Data source attribution on every visualization
- Confidence intervals on predictions
- "Last updated" timestamps
- Method transparency tooltips
- Export capabilities for analysis verification

### G. Accessibility & Performance
- High contrast mode for outdoor field use
- Keyboard navigation for all map interactions
- Progressive loading for large datasets
- Mobile-responsive design for field data collection

**Visual Hierarchy**: Data accuracy and scientific rigor take precedence over aesthetic flourishes. Clean, functional design that builds trust through transparency and precision.
